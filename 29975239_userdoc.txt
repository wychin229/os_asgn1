   in the terminal.
   
   gcc 29975239_fileutil.c -o fileutil
   
   the above command line entry will compile the program and produce an executable
   name "fileutil".
   
   *In order to compile and run the program in the correct directory, you can 
   either use the cd command to cd to the appropriate directory. Or you can use
